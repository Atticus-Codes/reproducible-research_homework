# Question 4

**a)** Two random paths are simulated in separate plots within a two-dimensional plane, with both x and y coordinates ranging from positive to negative values. Each path takes steps of 0.25 units in a random direction, with the step size uniform despite the axis scale. A color gradient on the paths indicates the passage of time, where dark blue represents early time steps, and light blue represents later time steps.

The paths are not continuous; rather, they consist of many small segments connecting successive locations, and there are no restrictions on the paths, meaning they can overlap with previously visited areas. Both plots start at the (0, 0) coordinates of the x and y axes.

In the left plot, the path's y-values range from approximately -5 to 1, and the x-values span from about -2 to 3. In the right plot, the y-values range from -1 to 4, and the x-values range from -1 to 4.5. Both paths finish after 500 time units. Given the number of random choices involved, it is highly unlikely that the same plot would be reproduced twice.

The color gradient on each path represents the passage of time, with darker colors indicating earlier steps and lighter colors indicating later steps.

**b)** A random seed is an initial value used to initialize a pseudorandom number generator (PRNG), which produces a sequence of numbers that appears random but is actually deterministic. The seed determines the starting point of the number generation process, ensuring that the sequence can be reproduced consistently. Without a seed, PRNGs typically produce different sequences of numbers each time they are used, often influenced by factors like the system clock. Although the numbers generated by a PRNG are not truly random, they follow a distribution that appears random. The importance of using a random seed lies in its ability to ensure reproducibility, especially in contexts like research, simulations, and debugging, where consistent results are crucial. For example, in game development or scientific computing, setting the same seed allows the exact same sequence of "random" events, such as level generation or algorithm testing, to be recreated. While the seed itself does not directly control the randomness, it establishes a predictable starting point for the sequence. Pseudorandom number generators rely on mathematical algorithms (like trigonometric functions) to generate numbers, which are used to simulate randomness. The sequence produced by a PRNG can be reproduced if the same seed is used, making it especially useful for debugging or comparing results across different trials.

# Question 5

**a)** The table has 33 rows and 13 coloumns

**b)** To Fit a linear model to the data on virion volume to genome length a log transformation can be applied 

**c)** Log transformed of an allometric equation linnearizes it into a form where 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6696ad1b-9c45-4056-a5bb-bf875c0ab149)
 Alpha = e^7.0748 = 1181.807 with p value of 2.28x10^-10
Beta = 1.5152 with value of 6.44x10^-10
Both figures have statistical significance and match those found in table 2 of supplementary of the paper. They have rounded their figures, to two d.p. in the beta colomn and to the nearest whole number in alpha colom.

**d)** see script in repository called virion_analysis.R






## Instructions

The homework for this Computer skills practical is divided into 5 questions for a total of 100 points. First, fork this repo and make sure your fork is made **Public** for marking. Answers should be added to the # INSERT ANSWERS HERE # section above in the **README.md** file of your forked repository.

Questions 1, 2 and 3 should be answered in the **README.md** file of the `logistic_growth` repo that you forked during the practical. To answer those questions here, simply include a link to your logistic_growth repo.

**Submission**: Please submit a single **PDF** file with your candidate number (and no other identifying information), and a link to your fork of the `reproducible-research_homework` repo with the completed answers (also make sure that your username has been anonymised). All answers should be on the `main` branch.

## Assignment questions 

1) (**10 points**) Annotate the **README.md** file in your `logistic_growth` repo with more detailed information about the analysis. Add a section on the results and include the estimates for $N_0$, $r$ and $K$ (mention which *.csv file you used).
   
2) (**10 points**) Use your estimates of $N_0$ and $r$ to calculate the population size at $t$ = 4980 min, assuming that the population grows exponentially. How does it compare to the population size predicted under logistic growth? 

3) (**20 points**) Add an R script to your repository that makes a graph comparing the exponential and logistic growth curves (using the same parameter estimates you found). Upload this graph to your repo and include it in the **README.md** file so it can be viewed in the repo homepage.
   
4) (**30 points**) Sometimes we are interested in modelling a process that involves randomness. A good example is Brownian motion. We will explore how to simulate a random process in a way that it is reproducible:

   a) A script for simulating a random_walk is provided in the `question-4-code` folder of this repo. Execute the code to produce the paths of two random walks. What do you observe? (10 points) \
   b) Investigate the term **random seeds**. What is a random seed and how does it work? (5 points) \
   c) Edit the script to make a reproducible simulation of Brownian motion. Commit the file and push it to your forked `reproducible-research_homework` repo. (10 points) \
   d) Go to your commit history and click on the latest commit. Show the edit you made to the code in the comparison view (add this image to the **README.md** of the fork). (5 points) 

5) (**30 points**) In 2014, Cui, Schlub and Holmes published an article in the *Journal of Virology* (doi: https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00362-14) showing that the size of viral particles, more specifically their volume, could be predicted from their genome size (length). They found that this relationship can be modelled using an allometric equation of the form **$`V = \alpha L^{\beta}`$**, where $`V`$ is the virion volume in nm<sup>3</sup> and $`L`$ is the genome length in nucleotides.

   a) Import the data for double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) viruses taken from the Supplementary Materials of the original paper into Posit Cloud (the csv file is in the `question-5-data` folder). How many rows and columns does the table have? (3 points)\
   b) What transformation can you use to fit a linear model to the data? Apply the transformation. (3 points) \
   c) Find the exponent ($\beta$) and scaling factor ($\alpha$) of the allometric law for dsDNA viruses and write the p-values from the model you obtained, are they statistically significant? Compare the values you found to those shown in **Table 2** of the paper, did you find the same values? (10 points) \
   d) Write the code to reproduce the figure shown below. (10 points)
